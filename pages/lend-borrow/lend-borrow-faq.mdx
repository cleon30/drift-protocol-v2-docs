# Lend Borrow FAQ

**Can the same collateral be used to trade perpetuals?**

*   Yes it can, up to the margin requirement.

**How does interest get charged on borrows?**

*   Interest automatically accrues to the account. Interest is paid in the same currency as the currency borrowed.

**Are there any fees on borrows?**

*   There is no borrow initiation fee.

*   Each spot market has a `total_if_factor` which allocates a portion of interest collected from borrows to the insurance fund.

**Are there any risks to lending?**

*   Yes, there is always the risk of *borrower default*. When there is not enough insurance available, the losses will be socialised across depositors. To help mitigate the risks, the protocol imposes prudent requirements and guards around borrows.
