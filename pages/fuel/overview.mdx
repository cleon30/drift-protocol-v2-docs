## Overview

FUEL is Drift’s first on-chain loyalty program for Driftoors designed to recognise those who continue to use Drift and are active participants in its mission. Your activity won’t go unrecognized — whether you’re actively trading perps or staking you can now kick things into high gear with FUEL. 

The FUEL program has been designed to take into consideration a broad range of activity throughout the Drift ecosystem. Your activity is represented with each FUEL you earn and you’ll be able to accelerate even faster with Activity Boosters.

## How do I Earn Fuel?

Watch your FUEL grow with each click. FUEL earnings are continuously added to your account while performing various actions on Drift, and can be viewed at [app.drift.trade/fuel](http://app.drift.trade/fuel). The total FUEL earned reflects the activity across all of your subaccounts.

The following activities on Drift earn FUEL:
<FuelBaseRatesTable />

Taker and maker FUEL earnings are added to your account immedaitely as the activity is completed.

All earn rates that are time-based, such as DRIFT staking, are also continuously added, but the amount is divided over a 28-day period. Example: if you stake 100 DRIFT, and the earn rate is 10 FUEL per DRIFT staked for 28 days, after one day you will have earned about 35.7 FUEL (10 FUEL / 28 days * 100 DRIFT).

As the FUEL program continues to be rolled out, rewards for other activities like deposits/lending, borrowing, and having open interest may be added in the future.

## What are Boosters?

Activity boosters provide an accelerated earn rate for different activities. The boosted rate is added to the base earn rate for the activity. Example: if the base earn rate for taker volume is 1 FUEL for every \$1, and there's a booster of 5 FUEL for every \$1 in SOL-PERP, then the earn rate for SOL-PERP becomes 6 FUEL for every \$1 in taker volume as long as the booster is active.

All currently active boosters and their rates can be found at: [app.drift.trade/fuel](http://app.drift.trade/fuel).

## What can I redeem FUEL for?

In the future, you’ll be able to burn (redeem) your FUEL to supercharge your Drift experience. The goal of the program is to recognize contributors and create a fun experience.

More details on what you can redeem your FUEL for and how to redeem it will be coming soon!
