## Overview

FUEL is Drift’s first on-chain loyalty program for Driftoors designed to recognise those who continue to use Drift and are active participants in its mission. Your activity won’t go unrecognized — whether you’re actively trading perps or staking you can now kick things into high gear with FUEL. 

The FUEL program has been designed to take into consideration a broad range of activity throughout the Drift ecosystem. Your activity is represented with each FUEL you earn and you’ll be able to accelerate even faster with Activity Boosters.

## How do I Earn Fuel?

Watch your FUEL grow with each click. The total FUEL earned reflects the activity across all of your subaccounts, no need to flip through each to tally it up.

You can watch your FUEL accumulate in real time from every day activity like:

- Perpetuals Trading
- Spot Trading
- Lending (Deposits)
- Staking

As features for the FUEL program continue to roll out, rewarding other activity like borrowing and open interest will be included in the future.

You can earn an unlimited amount of FUEL. No limits.

## What are Boosters?

Activity boosters provide an accelerated earn rate for different activities. You can see how much FUEL each activity earns on [app.drift.trade/fuel](http://app.drift.trade/fuel) and active boosters that give you an accelerated earn rate.

## What can I redeem FUEL for?

In the future, you’ll be able to burn (redeem) your FUEL to supercharge your Drift experience. The goal of the program is to recognize contributors and create a fun experience.

More details on what you can redeem your FUEL for and how to redeem it will be coming soon!
