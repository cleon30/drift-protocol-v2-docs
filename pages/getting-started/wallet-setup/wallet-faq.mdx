## Wallet FAQ

### Do I need SOL in my wallet?  

Yes, all interactions with the platform will require a small amount of SOL for the gas fees on the blockchain.  


### I have paid some SOL while creating an account on Drift. What is this?

It is called dynamic account rent and it is reclaimable. Every account pays an account rent of around 0.035 SOL to create an account on Drift. During sybil activity (when a lot of users are signing up), Drift's program adds an excess fee above this rent amount. For example, a user can pay 0.035 + 0.1901 SOL = 0.2251 SOL to create an account.

This amount can be fully redeemed. For the excess amount (0.1901 in the above example), users need to wait 7 days to reclaim their excess SOL rent. For the base rent (0.035 in the above example), users need to delete their account created on Drift to redeem that amount back.

Deleting an account deletes all history attached to that Drift account, and there is no retrieval for this.

Steps for reclaiming dynamic account rent: Click on your wallet address displayed in the top right corner of the screen. Click on 'Manage'. You'll see a trash/bin icon with a red color. Make sure:

- You don't have any open borrows on your account. You can check that on the 'Balances' page (opens in a new tab).
- Make sure you don't have any unsettled PnL. If you have any, make sure to settle it.
- Get your account to zero balances (Withdraw your balances from Drift).

Clicking the trash/bin icon will delete your account history and redeem your account rent instantly, without requiring any additional steps.

Steps for reclaiming excess fee: Users need to wait 7 days to reclaim their excess fee. Click on your wallet address displayed in the top right corner of the screen. Click on 'Manage'. Under 'reclaimable rent', you'll see a 'Claim' button. Clicking that button will instantly return any excess fee (if you paid while creating an account on Drift) to your account. 

### Does my wallet support versioned transactions?

Versioned transactions need to be turned on to use Drift's Swaps feature. Read more about versioned transactions and which wallets support it [here](/trading/versioned-transactions).
