# RPC Providers

Solana utilizes a network of [RPC Nodes](https://solana.com/rpc) to serve data to users. These nodes require a lot of resources to run and therefore can be quite expensive to operate.

Some of the commonly used free RPC providers are insufficient for operating drift bots because we require some functions that are commonly disabled (i.e. websockets and `getProgramAccounts`). [Helius](https://www.helius.dev/) has a generous free plan that is sufficient for getting started. But consider upgrading to a paid plan as you get more serious with operating bots on Drift or Solana in general.
