# Tutorial: Bots

### Introduction

There are two primary types of bots that run on Drift Protocol:

1.  Keeper Bots; and 

2.  Trading Bots. 

The reference implementation for all Keeper bots mentioned in these docs is available [here](https://github.com/drift-labs/keeper-bots-v2).

All bots require some amount of SOL to pay transaction fees. 

### Keeper Bots

Keeper Bots are integral to the performance of Drift Protocol. They perform automated actions as autonomous off-chain agents that are crucial to the platform. 

Keepers are rewarded depending on the duties that they perform.

The various types of keeper bots are:
