Drift Protocol is a decentralised peer-to-peer protocol that people can use to trade with certain perpetuals, swaps, spot assets and provide passive liquidity to earn yield from overcollateralized borrows. The protocol is made up of free, public, open-source or source-available software including a set of smart contracts that are deployed on various blockchain networks, including, without limitation, the Solana blockchain. Your use of the Drift Protocol and this UI involves various risks, including, but not limited to, risks inherent to cryptographic systems and blockchain-based networks, and losses due to network services, bugs, the fluctuation of prices of tokens and other assets underlying derivatives contracts and swaps.

Before using the Drift Protocol, you should review the Documentation available on our Site, the Terms of Use and the Risks to make sure you understand how the Drift Protocol works. Additionally, just as you can access email protocols such as SMTP through multiple email clients, you can access the Drift Protocol through a variety of web or mobile interfaces. You are responsible for doing your own diligence on those interfaces to understand the fees and risks they present.
