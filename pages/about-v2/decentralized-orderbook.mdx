# Decentralized Orderbook

## Overview

Drift's decentralised orderbook is powered by our network of [Keeper Bots](/about-v2/keepers). 

The Keeper Bots match open orders with various on-chain liquidity mechanisms once they cross or their trigger condition is met. These scenarios include:

-   Taker auction against Taker auction;

-   Taker/Maker limit orders against Taker auction;

-   Maker limit orders against Taker limit orders;

-   Taker/Maker orders against the Drift's AMM.

_Note: (1) two post only maker orders cannot be crossed; (2) maker orders that fill against the AMM are not eligible for rebate reward; and (3) limit orders can be filled by market orders that go through the JIT auction._

Keepers earn rewards that incentivise:

1.  providing the best execution for takers (relative to the oracle price) and;

2.  following First-Come-First-Serve execution ordering


While a robust Keepers network improves throughput/usability, the protocol's core functionality is not crunched upon it. Existing trading bots (JIT makers and resting order takers) implicitly fulfil the role of Keepers.

### Build Philosophy

The decentralised orderbook is designed with two core values in mind:

1.  decentralisation;  and

2.  computational efficiency.

_Decentralisation_ is achieved through our network of hybrid off-chain Keepers that anyone can build and run — similar to liquidator bots.

_Computational efficiency_ is achieved by leaving the order-filling logic — the part that requires the most computational power — off-chain, and filling them on-chain upon a trigger.

Hence, Drift’s unique limit order system is a _hybrid_ system that uses a combination off-chain Keepers and on-chain settlement.
